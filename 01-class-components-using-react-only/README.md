# Only Using React and class components

## basic tool-chain is create-react-app

In order to pass data(state) between components, I lift all states up to the outer layer.

This is called **Lifting State Up** in React. The more detailed example is [here](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html).

## Usage Tips

1. Left Click on ToDoLists is toggle the state, Active to Completed, or Completed to Active
2. Right Click will remove this line forever, be careful
