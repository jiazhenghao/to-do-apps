# What is this?

This repo is used for creating a simple but representative to-do-app using all kinds of techs including React, Redux, Vue and so on.

## 01 pure react, pure class components

## 02 function components, redux, react-redux(connect), redux-thunk(an async-simple solution)

## 03 rematch, a framework using redux, once rematch, never redux🤣

## 04 a big step forward, more powerful css styles😏, more features like rubbish-bin, restore, theme, multi-lingual, localStorage👊
