# One big step forward

## basic tool-chain is still **create-react-app**

In this chapter, I add css-styles to the to-do app. And use localStorage to store data permanently in each desktop. Themes and multi-language are also designed. This app is much more powerful now.

The stack is react, redux, react-router and back-end stack is also ready, with Express, MongoDB.
The next big step in Chapter 5 would be redux-saga and restful apis.
